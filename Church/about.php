                        <h6>JESUS OUR LEAD STORY</h6>
                        <p>
                            In fact, Jesus is our only story. He is preeminent in our hearts and central in all we do.We believe Jesus is unrivaled in history and eternity. He is God and He is good; glorious both now and forever. 
                            His Name is the only name that saves. His power is the only power that can raise us from the dead.
                            Our goal is not just to get people to church. Ultimately, we want people to meet Jesus. 
                            That’s why we say we are a Jesus church. 
                            We really don’t want to be identified by any other name.
                        </p>

                        <h6>The Gospel is CENTRAL </h6>

                        <p>
                            Everything we do is because of what Jesus has already done.

                            We believe that Jesus, who was God in human flesh, erased our debt on the cross and lives to be our life. Jesus did what we could never do to allow us to experience what we could never have apart from Him.
                            
                            The gospel we celebrate is not that our sin made us bad people and somehow Jesus makes us better. We believe our situation was far worse than that. Our sin left us spiritually dead and separated us from the perfect Father.
                            
                            Our good news is this: Jesus didn’t just come to make us better versions of ourselves. Jesus came to bring us from death to life.
            
                            All we do and say is anchored in this gospel story.
                        </p>

                    <div class="column block-list__item">
                        <h6>WORSHIP IS A LIFESTYLE</h6>

                        <p>
                            We love to worship and we love to sing. But for us, worship is more than singing songs. Worship is life.

                            The world is broken. People are hurting. In so much of Earth—disease, injustice, poverty, and neglect win the day. That’s why God wants more than a song. God wants justice for the poor and oppressed.
                            
                            We believe worship and justice are two sides of the same coin. Our best worship is the song we sing as we reach out to those in need.
                            
                            We believe there is no division between the sacred and the secular. Life is not about what you do, it’s about why you do it. Worship is doing everything we do to the fullest potential; using our unique gifts and opportunities to magnify Jesus everywhere, all the time.
                            
                            We love to work. Because we believe our work is worship when it’s done as a way of bringing honor to God.

                        <h6>GENEROSITY IS NORMAL</h6>

                        <p>
                            We are the recipients of the greatest gift the world has ever known—the love, grace and mercy of God. At no cost to us, yet at the highest cost to our Savior, we are free and forgiven forever. Our destiny has changed. Our identity is brand new. Our guilt is vanquished. Our eyes are opened.

                            Having freely received, we freely give.
                            
                            We believe Jesus is a giver and not a taker. Not only has He given us life and breath, but by His death and resurrection He defeated the sin that would rob us of both. So, when it comes to giving, we believe percentages are a thing of the past, and obligation is the wrong approach. Giving is worship—and our worship is a response to the extravagant grace and glory of God. Our response isn’t to calculate how little we can return to Him, but to offer God everything as our only appropriate thanks for all we have and are in Jesus.
                            
                            Generosity is not so much about our wealth as it is about our hearts, and our confidence in God over money.
                            
                            Generosity is not only for those with great net worth. We believe even what seems small can be used for great things when placed in the hands of God.

                        <p>
                            We believe that the death of Jesus Christ was the final and complete sacrifice for the sins of humanity. Salvation is obtained by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. All who repent of their sins and receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord are born again into eternal life as children of God.
